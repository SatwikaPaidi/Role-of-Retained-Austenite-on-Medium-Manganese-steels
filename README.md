Undergraduate Project on Role of Retained Austenite in Medium Manganese Steels which helps in automobile industry

**"Role of Retained Austenite in Medium Manganese Steels,"** investigates the microstructural and mechanical synergy in a $\text{Fe-6Mn-0.3C-3Al-1.5Si}$ alloy designed for **Advanced High-Strength Steels (AHSS)** in automotive applications The core objective is to understand how **retained austenite (RA)**, a metastable phase, contributes to the desirable strength-ductility balance through the **Transformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP)** effect under deformation. Preliminary characterization using **Optical Microscopy** and **SEM-EDX** confirmed a dual-phase microstructure with distinct elemental partitioning, where Mn and C preferentially enrich the austenite regions for stabilization. While **XRD** confirmed the dominant BCC ferrite phase, the subtle nature of the RA phase necessitates future advanced work, including **EBSD** and **synchrotron XRD**, to optimize its stabilization and fully correlate its transformation kinetics with macroscopic mechanical performance.
